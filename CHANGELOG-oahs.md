# Changelog — oahs

The oahs platform only. The root `CHANGELOG.md` belongs to upstream BMAD-METHOD,
whose tree this fork carries; it is not ours to write in.

Versions are sourced from [`oahs-version.json`](oahs-version.json) and tagged
`oahs-v*` — never `v*`, which is upstream's tag namespace.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-07-18

A corrective release. **0.1.0 shipped a data-loss bug**; this is the version to run.

### Fixed

- **Two `oahs serve` on one data dir no longer destroy it.** PGlite does not lock its
  directory, so two servers — two terminals, or a service restart racing a manual start,
  both defaulting to `~/.oahs/data` — both accepted writes and then corrupted the dir
  (`RuntimeError: Aborted()` at the next open). `oahs serve` now takes a cross-process
  lock and a second server refuses with a clear message. This was present in 0.1.0.
- **`$OAHS_PORT` is honoured by `serve`.** The runtime image advertised it and health-checked
  that port while `serve` read only `--port`, so `docker run -e OAHS_PORT=8080` bound 4521
  and the container was unhealthy forever.
- Two APIs stopped pretending: a scoped grant is now refused rather than silently applied
  globally, and `oahs ping` no longer constructs a meter nothing reads.

### Added

- **Schema-version guard.** `oahs serve` refuses to open a data dir written by a newer
  binary than itself, so an old binary cannot corrupt a newer dir. `GET /version` reports
  the `schemaVersion` it enforces.
- **CI for the carried BMAD tree and repo-wide style** (`tools` and `style` jobs), both
  now required. The carried installer no longer phones upstream's npm registry or steers
  fork users to install upstream over this fork.

### Docs

- Corrected claims that asserted machine-enforcement the code lacks (the "no writes outside
  the command bus" invariant holds by construction, not a lint rule; actor type is never a
  source of authority but two opt-in policy checks can restrict by it).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-17

First tagged version. It marks the point where the container execution path was
proven against a real Docker daemon in CI rather than a stub, which is the thing
that makes the rest worth versioning.

### What is in it

- **Deterministic spine.** Lifecycle, gates, claims, and evidence live behind a
  command bus; `packages/core/test/CONFORMANCE.md` is the specification, and the
  same suite runs against the in-memory engine and PGlite so the two cannot drift.
- **No model in the control loop.** CI greps `packages/{core,db,contracts}` and
  `apps/spine-api` for LLM SDKs and gateway imports on every push.
- **MCP and HTTP are the same surface**, structurally — `apps/spine-api/test/parity.test.ts`
  deep-equals them rather than trusting that they match.
- **Container-isolated execution (§10).** `oahs dispatch` claims work on the host
  with a static token, mints a job-scoped mutation-only token, and runs one
  container per claim. The agent container never receives the admin token, a push
  credential, or a Docker client — the last one is a failing CI assertion, not a
  convention. It DOES receive the model credentials its agent needs, on the inner
  `oahs work --agent-env` argv rather than in its environment, so they are not
  inherited by everything the agent shells out to. They never reach the spine.
- **Claim-scoped push credentials, a durability push, and spine-driven adoption**
  of a claim branch across machines.
- **A lease reaper** that records expiries without deciding anything.
- **A version surface**: `oahs --version` and `GET /version`, compiled from one file
  into the bundle, so they cannot drift. The OCI image labels take a `--build-arg`
  the release workflow feeds from that same file; an image you build by hand is
  honestly labelled `dev`.

### What is NOT in it

Stated plainly, because the absence of a feature is easier to mistake for its
presence than the reverse:

- **No Postgres server.** `serve` offers `memory` and `pglite` only, and nothing
  reads a `DATABASE_URL`. Note what this does NOT mean: `PgEngine` is not shelf-ware
  waiting to be wired — it IS the durable engine, and `serve --data` (the default,
  and what compose runs) is `PgEngine` on embedded PGlite. What is missing is a
  connection to a real Postgres server, not the engine.
- **No migrations**, but the schema is versioned. Idempotent, additive DDL is re-applied
  on every open. There is no down-migration; instead `oahs serve` REFUSES to open a data
  dir stamped by a newer binary than itself (`schema v… will not open it`), so an old
  binary cannot corrupt a newer dir. `GET /version` reports the same `schemaVersion`.
- **Nothing locks the data dir.** A second `oahs serve` on a directory already being
  served DESTROYS it, and needs no flags to do so: `--data` defaults to `~/.oahs/data`,
  so two bare `oahs serve` target the same place. Both accept writes and answer 200;
  the directory then fails to open at the next start with `RuntimeError: Aborted()`
  and does not recover. Run one spine per data dir, and copy the directory only while
  the server is stopped.

  0.1.0 shipped this bullet saying "two BINARIES against one data dir is possible and
  silent", filed under "No migrations". Every part of that was wrong: the trigger is a
  second PROCESS, not a second version; it is not about schema at all; and the
  inference it invited — "I am fine as long as I run one version" — is precisely the
  belief that loses your data.
- **No multi-tenancy.** There is no `workspace_id` column on any table.
- **Grant scopes are stored but not enforced.**
- **No metering, billing, SSO, or audit signing.**
- **No published image or package.** Images are built locally; nothing is on npm
  or a registry.

### Security posture

Evidence collected on a developer machine is only as strong as the honest-operator
assumption behind it. The §8 push guard, scoped tokens, and the container boundary
raise the cost of a dishonest agent; they do not make one impossible.
